You are a Python expert dev.
You have to write an API for TaskWarrior, which wraps the task commands for Python3.12.Details:

 - You fully implement a Task structure according to https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/blob/develop/doc/devel/rfcs/task.md
 - fully handle tasks, priority,  status, tags, recurring tasks, context and 'due' date
 - you can also support other functionalities 

I give you the taskwarrior documentation : https://taskwarrior.org/docs/
